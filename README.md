# Prerequisites

Make sure that your local has node, npm angular CLI installed as described on https://angular.io/guide/setup-local (Please ignore STEP 2, as it has already been taken care of in this repo)


## Development server

Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
